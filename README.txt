1. In the traditional model, the form's action specifies what happens when the submit button is pressed. How does the sample code connect the submit button to jQuery? (i.e., what line(s) of code do this).

2. What PHP file will be executed on the server?

3. How does this code collect data from the form to pass to the server/php?

4. What line of JavaScript code is executed in the callback function?

5. How does the PHP function provide the value to be displayed in the callback function? (i.e., what line of code "returns" the message that is displayed).
